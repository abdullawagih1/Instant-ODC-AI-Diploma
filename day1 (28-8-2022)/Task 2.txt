Operating systems are written in low level languages like assembly, C, C++.

Because low languages are close to machine instructions and can able to interact easily with the hardware in less time.

For example:

Unix operating system was totally written in C by Ken Thompson and Dennis retchie.

Windows Os was written mostly in c++, Assembly.

Upper interface of ANDROID Os is totally written in Java,which provides a Java API for interacting with the kernel, 
the kernel used for Android is Linux kernel,linux kernel is also totally written C with version of GCC.
