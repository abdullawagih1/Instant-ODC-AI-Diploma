conda is both a command line tool, and a python package.

Miniconda installer = Python + conda

Anaconda installer = Python + conda + meta package anaconda

meta Python pkg anaconda = about 160 Python pkgs for daily use in data science

Anaconda installer = Miniconda installer + conda install anaconda

=============================
-Miniconda gives you the Python interpreter itself, along with a command-line tool called 
 conda which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared toward Python packages, 
 similar in spirit to the apt or yum tools that Linux users might be familiar with.

-Anaconda includes both Python and conda, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed 
 packages geared toward scientific computing. Because of the size of this bundle, expect the installation 
 to consume several gigabytes of disk space.
